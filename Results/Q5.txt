# Look for urgent or threatening language in the email body.

Artificial Time Constraints

Phishing emails often create a false sense of urgency to bypass your critical thinking.
"Urgent": The subject line immediately flags the message as a critical priority.
"Suspended within the next 12 hours": This specific timeframe is designed to make you act quickly before you have time to verify the claim.
"Immediately": The email demands that you verify your identity right away.


Threats of Severe Consequences
The email uses threats of permanent loss to scare the recipient into compliance.
"Permanent suspension": It warns that failure to act will result in the account being suspended forever.
"Permanent closure will occur": This reinforces the idea that the loss of the account is final.
"Access... will be blocked": A direct threat that you will lose access to your funds and banking services.


Legal Intimidation
"Avoid legal action": The final note escalates the threat beyond simple banking issues to potential legal consequences, which is highly irregular for a standard security alert.
