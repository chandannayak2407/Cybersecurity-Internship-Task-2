1. What is phishing?
Phishing is a cybercrime where attackers pose as legitimate institutions to trick individuals into providing sensitive data. In the provided document, the attacker poses as a "Bank Security Team" and demands the user "verify your identity"  to steal credentials.

2. How to identify a phishing email?
You can identify phishing by looking for specific red flags, all of which are present in this sample:
Urgency: The subject line screams "A Urgent" and threatens suspension "within the next 12 hours".
Generic Greetings: It uses "Dear Customer"  instead of the recipient's name.
Suspicious Links: The URL secure-your-bank-account.com  does not match the sender's domain.
Grammar Errors: The subject line uses incorrect grammar ("A Urgent").

3. What is email spoofing?
Spoofing is the act of forging an email header so the message appears to come from a trusted source. In this case, the sender uses the address support@secure-bank-update.com to look official, even though the signature claims to be from "National Banking Group Pvt Ltd".

4. Why are phishing emails dangerous?
They are dangerous because they can lead to:
Credential Theft: The email directs users to a login page (/login) to harvest passwords.
Malware Infection: The email includes an attachment Account_Verification_Form.pdf, which could contain malicious code.
Financial Loss: The text threatens that "permanent closure will occur"  to scare users into giving up control of their funds.

5. How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?
You should verify that the sender's email domain matches the organization they claim to represent. Here, the sender is secure-bank-update.com , which is a generic domain that does not match the organization "National Banking Group Pvt Ltd" listed in the footer.


6. What tools can analyze email headers?
While specific software tools aren't listed in the document, you can manually analyze the header fields provided:
From: Check the sender address support@secure-bank-update.com.
To: Verify if the recipient address asishsingh2345@gmail.com  was targeted individually or as part of a bulk list.
Date: Ensure the timestamp Wed, 10 Dec 2025  aligns with when the email was received.

7. What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?
Do Not Click: Avoid the link https://secure-your-bank-account.com/login.
Do Not Open Attachments: Ignore the file Account_Verification_Form.pdf.
Report: Forward the email to the actual bank's fraud department.
Ignore Threats: Disregard intimidation tactics like "avoid legal action".

8. How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?
Social engineering manipulates psychology to force a reaction. This email uses:
Fear: Threatening "legal action" and "permanent suspension".
Urgency: Setting a deadline of "12 hours"  to bypass critical thinking.
Authority: Signing off as the "Bank Security & Risk Management Team"  to command obedience.
