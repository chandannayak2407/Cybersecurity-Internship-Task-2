#  Summarize phishing traits found in the email.

1. Sender Anomalies
Suspicious Sender Address: The email originates from a generic domain <support@secure-bank-update.com> rather than a specific financial institution's official domain.
Inconsistent Branding: The sender is listed as "Bank Security Team" and claims to be from "National Banking Group Pvt Ltd", but the email domain does not match this organization's name.

2. Suspicious Links and Attachments
Generic URL: The verification link https://secure-your-bank-account.com/login uses a generic, unbranded domain that differs from the sender's email domain.
Dangerous Attachment: The email includes a PDF attachment titled "Account_Verification_Form.pdf". This is highly irregular, as legitimate banks typically direct users to secure portals rather than sending PDF forms, which are common vectors for malware.

3. Urgent and Threatening Language
Artificial Deadlines: The email creates panic by stating the account will be suspended "within the next 12 hours".
Threats of Consequence: It warns of "permanent suspension" and "permanent closure" if the user does not act immediately.
Legal Intimidation: A note at the bottom threatens "legal action" if the email is ignored.

4. Grammar and Formatting Errors
Subject Line Error: The subject line contains a grammatical error: "A Urgent" instead of the correct "An Urgent".
Informal Phrasing: The phrase "Please do not ignore this mail" uses informal language ("mail" instead of "email") and awkward sentence structure.
